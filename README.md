HOW TO USE TRIPPER: 

1. Login or signup on the landing page
2. If you don't have any trips yet, create a new one. You can invite friends by their email addresses. Note that they have to be registered on the website, and once a trip has been created, you cannot add any more users. 
3. You can now add costs and exchange rates to your specific road trip. An exchange rate is a translation mechanism for converting non-monetary contributions into Tokens, for example, 1 hour driving = 5 Tokens. A cost takes a value and a unit defined by members of the trip, and is eventually converted into Tokens. 
4. On the side bar, you can view the total costs of the trip, your personal contributions and how much people owe you. 
5. You can also see the exchanges, with rates and units; and choose to add, edit or delete. Note that you can only delete an exchange that doesn't have costs dependent on it. 
6. You can also add a new cost, defining the value and units, and view all your costs across all your trips. 
7. On the bottom left, you can also see the recently added costs by user. 
8. In the center of the page, you can see the total costs summary and your own personal cost sumamry in a beautiful interface.
